- CSG Debug - no icon
- Ice Boss - icon built-in
- Metal Boss - icon built-in
- Sandbox - icon provided by mod; will only be visible to people with the mod

### 1v1 Test

Desert biome with lots of tight passes.  Probably the prototype for designed planets, packaged as a biome rather than the new planetCSG attribute.  We don't know the planet parameters like radius, however.

### CSG Debug

Dev test for brushes; more of a curiosity than a practical planet type.

### Ice Boss

In Galactic War, the Foundation have a special biome type with with ice, volcanos, hot water, and maybe a metal crater. Curiously, the metal trenches are also used, but with BO_Add, and are not visible, except possibly for some odd strips cut through the snowy areas.

### Metal Boss

Normally this only appears in the GW Synchronous boss system. Has a metal crater, and does not function as a laser.

### Sandbox

The sandbox biome is used in the dev's internal test mode. It has a grid texture, supports water, and has no brushes or features, so it's a little kinder on load times and RAM.
